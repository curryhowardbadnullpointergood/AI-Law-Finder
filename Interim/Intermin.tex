{\Huge \textbf{Abstract}}\\[1cm]

Physical laws are generalisation established through empirical observations
of the physical world. It has taken humans centuries to discover, requires huge
amounts of research, repeated experiments and plenty of scientists to produce
an universally accepted law in the scientific community. Thanks to recent
advances in neural networks and increased computational power, we can now
train models to replicate and fasten our discovery of physical laws such as the
laws of motion,also including chaotic systems such as the double pendulum,
drastically shortening the time required to find new physical laws. Furthermore
human’s have a cognitive bias when looking at data, find it difficult to spot
patterns in chaotic systems. This report explores how an AI without any bias or
prior knowledge views the physical world, how it is capable of spotting chaotic
patterns and how it is a tool that can reduce the time taken to make new
discoveries.\\

\section{Introduction: }

\subsection{Goals: }

It took humans centuries to derivie physical laws, can this process be sped up through AI, by feeding it data and letting the model derive complex laws for us. I aim to derive physical laws, from experimental data. I will explore deriving simpler physical laws such as acceleration without air resistance, and move onto to complex chaotic systems such as pendulums, and explore how an unbiased AI views the physical world, compared to humans who's views of physical systems are naturally biased through systematic learning. 

Can this lead to perhaps different prespectives of viewing the physical world around us, allowing for further progress? 


\subsection{Scope: }


 - Aim to derive simple laws of motions (ie acceleration) through AI frameworks.\\ 

- Move onto more complex systems such as pendulums, and initially explore smaller initial values, moving onto larger initial values, 
thereby increasing the chaos, and difficulty of spotting patterns. \\

- To explore using various AI techniques, (Graph Neural Networks, Deep learning, Neural Networks) in combination with no prior knowledge and observe how and in what form the physical laws are derived.  
- Simulate physical data required using pymunk, and perhaps use real world data from physics labs.\\
