old abstract: 

Physical laws are generalisation established through empirical observations of the physical world. It
has taken humans centuries to discover, requires huge amounts of research, repeated experiments and
plenty of scientists to produce an universally accepted law in the scientific community. Thanks to
recent advances in neural networks and increased computational power, we can now train models to
replicate and fasten our discovery of physical laws such as the laws of motion,also including chaotic
systems such as the double pendulum, drastically shortening the time required to find new physical
laws. Furthermore humanâ€™s have a cognitive bias when looking at data, find it difficult to spot patterns
in chaotic systems. This report explores how an AI without any bias or prior knowledge views the
physical world, how it is capable of spotting chaotic patterns and how it is a tool that can reduce the
time taken to make new discoveries.
