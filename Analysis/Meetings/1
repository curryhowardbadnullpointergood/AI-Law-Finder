\section{Basic Information:}

100\% bullshit continuous assessment, that is horrible. In many ways.\\ 

450 hours estimated. Yeah that's fucked, so x2 multiplier atleast 1k hours.\\ 

Falsification: You must not fabricate, modify or distort any data, evidence, references, experimental results, or other material used or presented in your work. You must clearly describe your experiments and how the results were obtained, and include all data, source code and/or designs (either in the report, or submitted as a separate file) so that your results could be reproduced. \\

Fucking aids is what this is. LMAO.\\ 
Really not worth it.\\ 

The University has its own Git service, which we would suggest you use (and set private) rather than using GitHub. You can control access to your repository, e.g. you could grant access to your GDP team and supervisor. You can move code from GitHub to git.soton.ac.uk by following the steps written by Jules. \\

Probably a good idea, to push this shit to my own git account, or maybe make a new git, yh make a new git, then push these changes to it. \\


Fucking in hell man, way better to do leet code and semi cheat then go all in on this bullshit.\\ 

So I guess first thing is the idea phase, what idea should I decide to work on. I don't know, so I will look at what people in previous years have done, and analyse it. \\ 


\subsection{Project Archive count: }

  
  CNN: 1, 1,\\ 
  LLM: 1, 1, 1, 1, \\
  Agents/Active learning: 1,\\ 
  Generative AI: 1, 1, 1, \\
  NN: 1, \\
  Computer Vision: 1, 1, 1, 1, \\

  This gives me a rough idea of where to start, looking. \\ 

  
  Still not very useful though. \\

\section{Project Briefings:}

\subsection{Introduction to Project Allocation:}

Slides:\\

Largest Piece of Individual Work:\\
Worth 45 Credits:\\
Must pass to get degree, wow amazing\\ 
3/8 of the marks for PART III\\
Students spend 2 days a week on sem 1, and an avg of 3 days a week on sem2.\\ 
Fucking shit show, but makes sense 450 hours, yikes.\\ 

\subsection{Assessment:}

10 percent on Progress  Report:\\
80 percent on Final Report\\
10 percent on Viva\\

15 Credits on Semester 1\\
30 Credits on Semester 2:\\

\subsection{Project Ideas:}

Come up with multiple ideas, don't be lazy and present this to your supervisor.\\ 


\subsection{Project Schedule:}

Regular Meetings, Once a week\\

Project Brief, 1 page document tell them what the project is on, and what you want to achieve.\\ 

Progress Report, a deliverable at the end of Semester 1 describing my progress\\

Semester 2:\\

Meet second supervisor.\\ 


Good cop Bad Cop\\

10k word deliverable.\\ 
Bullshit\\ 

If things aren't going well, go to your project supervisor, 2nd examiner, senior tutors, PAT \\ 

3 links at the end, which I will look at.\\

Other Video isn't of much use anymore.\\

\section{Introduction + Project Management: }

Project Management Slides. To the merit of David Millard, these slides 
seem like someone actually put some effort into them.\\ 

I sort of take that back, this is made like it was meant for children. I suppose for the chinese. \\ 


Project Management helps you allocate resources to solve complex tasks in a manner that is explainable to others, demonstrates you have thought it through, and is useful to the completion of the project, a plan is of course necessary and a good thing. \\ 


It is better to be Real than Right, practical decisions should be based on you r real skills, rather than the skills you think you have.\\ 


When planning the tempatation is to assume everything will go right, this isn't true. Account for problems and failures.\\ 

Critical Path Analysis, again a very helpful and smart tool.\\ 

Do a Risk Assessment, simply list the things that can go wrong, and plan appropriately.\\


Planning is one of the biggest obstacles, you need to plan what you are going to do and when you are going to do it.\\ 


\section{Academic Integrity BS:}

Apparently paraphrasing and using multiple sources, then using them in the referene is bad / plagarishm.\\ This is really aids. This is some bullshit extrapolated to the tits.\\ 

Leaveraged to the moon, fuck sake man, these guys need to chill with the plagarism.\\ 

I need to do this project before I start University or else I'm fucked.\\ 

 Yh so a sane guy in the audience smells the bullshit.\\ 

Oh okay well this should be obvious, but do not use WIKIPEDIA at all, this goes in general I suppose, it's best if the actual sources I use are obscure, and hard to find.\\ 

Wow, now here's a dig at chinese students.\\ 
Geez.\\

Plagarism if you take too much from one source.\\
Simply translate a source from another language.\\ 
So they can see matching submission from other universities.\\ 
Holy fuck man, exactly only a certain number of ways of saying something technical, aho crosic is aho crosic.\\

numpy is numpy mat plot lib is mat plot lib this is insanity.\\ 


Here comes a leftist piece of shit video, where they catch trumps wife saying the same shit as machielle obama.\\ 


Content, and words that match, are signs of plagarism. HOly shit man\\ 

Cite sources, morality, author has the right to be acknowledged,\\ Blah blah bull shit, count to 10,\\ 

\subsection{Assessment:}

send ack to bibilography and cite bs.\\

\subsection{How to avoid Plagarism:}

Four things to remember:\\

1. Quoting, paraphrasing, citing, referene list.\\ 

4 fuckery\\\

IEEE citations, check with supervisor, keep consistent.\\ 
Man I'm getting piles watching this crap, need to speedrun to the maxx.\\ 

Cite figures/images. Complete bullshit.\\ 
If you adapt then say it is adapted, if you copied then say you reproduced it from that paper.\\ 

Use referene gay software management lesbian bs.\\ 

Oh yeah this guy  is a well aids.\\ Really don't want to have a meething with this shit.\\ 

Be super anal about citations, and imagine you are in a temple, as soon as you bring any dirt in, clean it up with a broom, as soon as I copy paste anything in i NEED TO CITE CITE CITE it!!!!!!!!\\\

Or even if it is an idea, I need to pharaphrase and CITE the fuckers.\\ 

acknowledged open source code, ohhhh myyy god. What the actual fuck.\\ 
You should be clear on how you've used it.\\ 
Obfuscating/renaming variables is not enoughm, ugh aiyaaaa\\ 

 These aids use turnitin, also you plagiarism checkers for code. oH WOW THEY NEED A   medal.\\ 


 YH so this dickhead, proceeds to show how a paper tha's been quite nicely copied pasted the good old. aand nothong is going to fucking happen to the guy. Yet they make us student follow these penal stringent rules. man fuck this shit.\\ 


Yeah so they use JPlag, so I need to download Jplan and mess if it if it comes that that.\\ 

They for some reason want you to avoid using online plagarism checkers. wow man.\\ 

oh so they will sell your work to other student, if you use plagarism checker, so ask for advice from supervisor.\\ 


Collusion seems to be the 2nd most common source of problems, so,\\ 
I will not talk about my work with anyone else, or if I do completely mislead them and confuse them giving them the impression I myself am confused.\\ 

Do not show anyone my work, so I cvan even chatgtp generate fake copies in case for the fuckery of it hehe.\\ 

Do not store on GIthub, all my work is going to be on good ole harddrives, usbs bitches.\\ 

External Authorship:\\ 
Ugh yikes, yeah this if I use it, I've severely fucked up. SO no, if if you do then do it throughly and anon.\\

Do not use chatgtp3. I mean stfu you can't catch it.\\ 

False data is treated seriously, man these people should be burnt.\\ 

Own work Own work should be own work, man relax,\\ 

Need ethics approval before using any human animal related.\\ 
This also applies to secondary use of data, any analysis of human data needs ethical data, |OHHHHH MYYYYY GOOOOD for fuck sake. PEnile to the max.\\ 

Yeah man the project isn't even hard its this shit.\\ 

\section{Careers briefing:}

So UoS Career Hub has plenty of helpful resources, need to give this an actual visit, and learn the basics from them. Will be good to keep in mind, and go 100'5 after finishing off the project this summer.\\





\section{Ethics is overrated, fuck the geneva convention:}

Any true scientist knows ethics holds back humanity,\\ 

The University requires the ethical consideration of all research which involves human participants, human tissue, human data, cultural artefacts or animals\\

Oh and lol they went on to give examples of places that didn't do this shit, places that are all ranked higher than soton.\\ 

I might need this for machine learning, well man, better to email that fucker, head of Academic Integrity of smth, or other faculty members, just to be sure, and of cource also ask friends.\\ 

Anything with human in it, needs approval.\\ 
tldr.\\ 

Ethics approval required if the study involves humans or their data or will affect humans (or involves cultural artefacts or animals)
Template Ethics forms and examples are available
Retrospective approval not available
The ethical issue is the treatment of the participants, ensuring
	Full disclosure, 
	Informed (research) consent, and 
	Protection of privacy (DPA)
	Data retention
Really good reasons will be required for intrusion, risk of harm, or deception \\

There goe s the exploding drone, man fuck this shit.\\

Need this for public DATASETS!!!!\\
CRAZY, board of ethics does this so those leftist fuckers can keep their dumb board going and earn money,.\\\ 

\section{Risks:}

Seems to be a repeat of anal eml MODULE.\\ 

There's also supply chain bs, so If you are biying electronics, don't think I will need to do this, but good to keep in mind.\\ 

\section{Evaluating Projects:}


Report must be written for the audience,
i.e. somebody on the same course as you
but without any knowledge of your
subject area.\\


\subsection{Why Evaluate?}
Propoganda bs.\\ 

Understanding the real world. Comparing designs, etc.\\ 

  Technical evaluation
– Program runs without errors
– Calibration\\


User evaluation
– Meeting users’ needs
– Intuitive\\

Let's be honest, I only really give a fuck about technical evaluation.\\ 

Evaluate against design requirements
• The quality of your evaluation relies
partly on the quality of your aims and
your design requirements\\

Which is why it's so much better from a grade point of view for me to acter this after I finish off my project, or heavily edit it, to make it seem like I overchieved.\\ 

How do you plan your evaluation?\\
1. Define project aims and design requirements\\
2. Determine metrics of success for each aim\\
3. Map your evaluation to your aims\\
Adjust aims to ensure ease of evaluation\\

Why the actual fuck is ECS obsessed with air quality.\\ 
Pathetic excuse for a maketable commercial product.\\ 
At what point in your project do you
evaluate?\\
oh tell me geniuses. \\ 






ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\\
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\
Every minute it feels like I might as well become a male stripper/porn star.\\ 

Human centric design cuck cycle..\\ 

Prototype your design early on.\\ 

Seems like evaluation is real piece of shit.\\ 


\section{Design for Manufacture}


for the electronic nerds, wont be surprised if ecs got commision from their recommended manufactureres, fuck ecs, and their dumb attempt at drop shipping.\\ 



\section{Technical Resources: }



If you find yourself doing long compute jobs on your laptop or a lab machine, use Lyceum.
If you find yourself doing intensive jobs on your laptop or lab machine, use Lyceum.
We have 2 Super Computers for you to use. 
Lyceum4 High clock speed per core. Single thread behemoth.
Lyceum5 GPUs for Floating point calculations and machine learning.
https://www.southampton.ac.uk/isolutions/staff/high-performance-computing.page\\

Actually useful for AI\\

\section{Where they try sell the PhD scam to you:}

Not that it is a scam, but pretty aids.\\ 
4 years of shit, you get paid fuck all, to use world class facilities, oh sorry I meant 30 year old monitors that barely work.\\ 

I mean I would really do one, I like computer science, don't mind, but time is limited. And I'd rather spend 4 years on something else in complete honesty, 22 is a lot younger than 25/26, 25 with debt, or 25 with 2 shops earning 150k + \\ 

The choice is sort of obvious.\\ 

Life has limited time. 4 years is atleast 4 to 5 percent of your life, not worth it tbh.\\ 

\section{Project Writeup:}

Slides as recording takes 48 hours, and no one has time for that aids, and if I grind I can do like 5 percent of this project in that time eazy.\\ 

I need to actually hand this in time. So assume this is due in 1 week early·\\ 

 Hand your report in on time\\
• 10\% penalty per day!\\
• Keep to the word limit\\
• Don’t use more than 10,000 words in the main body of your report\\
• Proof-read your report\\

Use proper references\\

\subsection{Typical report content:}

A clear statement of the problem and goals of the project\\
• A review of the background literature\\
• An analysis and specification of the solution to the problem\\
• A detailed design\\
• The implementation\\
• Testing strategy and results\\
• A critical evaluation\\
• Conclusions and future work\\
• References to the literature\\
• Appendix (e.g. project \& time management)\\
• copy of original project brief, one or more Gantt/PERT charts\\

Describes the report strcuture, which I should honestly look into more when I'm actually writing this shit.\\ 



Your supervisor will advise on structure
• Every project is different
• You may need to vary the typical structure\\



Top down
• Start with a list of chapters
• Add section and sub-section headings
• Write each section\\



Bottom up
• Start by writing something
• (whatever seems important)
• Arrange the material into sections and chapters\\

In reality – you will do a mixture of both\\

Professional writers are usually very disciplined, arguable\\



You must be able to carry on regardless\\
• In severe cases we can allow one or two days extra, but don’t expect several weeks\\
• Keep backups online (the University provides OneDrive)\\\
• Keep physical backups in a separate room and building\\

Yh I don't trust uni onedrive, so uni git, code, fabricated of course.\\ 

Backup real sit on local, usbs, multiple of them. sd card, on my home server, backup ssd's.\\ 


I can't say all of this work is mine, since this topic is so aids will cross this bridge when I get to it, but remember to document everything, every influence etc. \\ 

The examiners will consider:\\
• Your progress (interim) report\\
• Your project management and planning\\
• Your technical approach, engineering, analysis, design\\
• Your testing, evaluation, reflection\\
• Your achievement, innovation, challenge, contribution\\
• Your report writing, format, structure, references\\
• Your knowledge and understanding in your viva/demo/report\\


The report looking long man, not gonna lie. Not sure I can give a fuck about a flimsy report when applying for 100k jobs in new york.\\ 


Comparative evaluation (cf. competition)\\
• performance graphs, feature lists\\

Critical evaluation\\
• with respect to your project goals and plan\\

Reflection\\
• Did you use the right tools, techniques, metrics and methods?\\
• What did you learn?\\
• Were your goals and plan sensible?\\
• How could you have done it better/differently?\\


So that's it for this webpage. Time to start reading through the other information.\\ 



\section{Detailed Project Guidelines:}


Student gets second examiner cuz one is supposed to be good cop, the other is bad cop.\\ 

FUCK A PHD\\ 

If at each such meeting a second examiner wants to know (for example) about the practical uses of the project, a student who addresses the practical uses of their project in the final report will probably do better than one who doesn't. \\

Oh they want practicality, such bs man. Probably want to  make better products with our work, and considering the state that cs department is in with the funny air filters, can't even find this shit funny.\\ 

\section{Outline Project Schedule and Deliverables:}
The schedule cannot be met unless the supporting work is done in a timely manner, so students must plan their work and manage their time. Students should expect to spend about 1.5 days per week on their project - right from the outset. This is about one third of the working week and reflects the relative weightings of the marks for the project and other part III modules. \\

Oh yeah baby, 15 hour busting this project. Soon as Adam gives the green light.\\ 

\section{Agreed Project Brief (Autumn term):}

n the first week of the autumn term the project brief must be agreed. Students must write a description of their project which is agreed between themselves and their supervisors. This will be filed formally before the third week of term (for the precise deadline see the Project schedule).\\

The project brief must be on one side of A4 and contain:\\

    The student's name\\
    The agreed project title\\
    The supervisor's name\\
    The agreed project description: problem, goals and scope\\

An electronic copy of this document must be submitted in PDF format via the ECS Handin System.\\

This is an electronic only submission. There is no need to submit any paperwork.\\

Supervisors will be able to access the electronic copy via the Your Project Students page on the ECS Handin System. \\

\section{Second Examiner Allocation:}

The bad cop enters the game aiyaaah.\\ 

\section{Progress Report:}

The progress report is marked by the project supervisor alone (the second examiner will be able to access an electronic copy of the report but will not be involved in the marking process until the final report is submitted). \\

Failure to submit a progress report in the approved format by the deadline will result in its part of the project mark being subject to a 10\% penalty per working day late. A progress report submitted more than 5 days late will result in the relevant part of the project mark being set to zero.\\

Holy flying fuck. This is sort of bad. Need to hand this in 1 week early.\\  

\section{Final Report (Summer term):}


Shortly after the Easter break, a final report must have been submitted.\\ 
So basically I want my final report to be done on the end of the Easter Break, and go through it with both supervisors.\\ 

The award of an honours degree is conditional on the submission of a project report. \\


Failure to submit a final report in the approved format by the deadline will result in the total project mark being subject to a 10\% penalty per working day late. A report submitted more than 5 days late will result in a mark of zero (for more details see the Project schedule). \\

So its pretty obvious this is aids to the max.\\ 

\section{Project Viva:}

Obviously this bs affects the rest of the grade. Oh wow, such aids, aids to the maxx, aids high.\\

Hope I don't get woke second prof.\\ 


The viva may include a demonstration of the system, depending on availability of equipment and time. It often proves difficult to demonstrate a system adequately in the time available. However, it is strongly recommended that students ensure that both of their examiners see their final work. For this reason, students may need to arrange additional appointments between the report hand-in time and the exams.\\ 

Third Examiners

Under certain circumstances (e.g. where the first two examiners are unable to agree on a mark), a third examiner may be needed. The third examiner is likely to want to see a demonstration of the project and will usually hold a second viva. There is no timetable for these second vivas but they will usually be arranged in one of the second semester exam weeks (i.e. within 3 weeks of the first viva). \\

This is sort of dick thing to do, hopefully the 2 dickhead agree on a mark.\\ 

\section{Project Report Standards:}

Reports should be clearly typed on A4 portrait pages, double-sided, normal spacing. Lines must either be ragged right or fully justified.

Text should be in a proportionally-spaced, 12pt serif font such as Palatino, Times or Computer Modern. \\


referencing aids, fuck sake man.\\ 

\section{Colour:}

Although colour may be used to enhance the presentation of a project, it is not good practice to rely on colour to communicate essential details.

Where a paper copy is created, black-and-white printing is faster and cheaper than colour printing. Taking this into account, it is likely that examiners who prefer to mark paper copies will be reading the reports in black and white. Thus it is best to use colour sparingly within the report. \\

can;t use colour as examiners aer cheap. Amazing. Offer to print it oof to your supervisor for free, so the colour issue can be tackled.\\ 

\section{PDF files:}

Yeah this is a real aids moment. man. NGL this needs to be sorted at least a few days before I submit it. The submission process seems like the last little fuck you at the end.\\

\section{Design and Data Archive:}

Great this is so other students can go off and steal your work, so the chinese have something to fucking steal again, oh my my my.\\ FUCK THIS SHIT!!!\\


Note that there is no separate mark for the agreed project brief but the timeliness of its submission will affect marks awarded later for project management. Also the achievement of the project will be measured in part against plans described in the project brief agreed between the student and the supervisor. For this reason neither the progress report nor the final report can be marked if a project brief acceptable to both the student and the supervisor has not been submitted. \\

Oh wow, this is pretty anal.\\ 

HOpefully adam isn't a dick.\\ 

Yep definitely want to avoid resits at all costs.\\ 
Also want to avoid plagarism bullshit.\\ 


\section{Research Papers: }


This is a section about research papers, and improving my knowledge about this niche. Will aim to go through a variety of papers, to get a better grade. \\ 

It is better to do more now, than to do more near the deadline and fuck up 2 hours before the deadline. 

It will be helpful to find examples, so I suppose I'll ask victor, german and ellie. \\ 

\subsection{Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a
General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: }

tabula rasa - people are turned into who they are due to experiences.\\ 

So this technique works, so that is good, now question is if I implement 
just this, that isn't very "challenging," so I suppose I will have to increase this aspect of the project through some application of theory, good this is 
this has already been done before so it is possible, which is good.\\ 


"Recently, the AlphaGo Zero algorithm
achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by representing Go knowledge using
deep convolutional neural networks (22, 28), trained solely by reinforcement learning from
games of self-play (29). "\\

Shogi is a significantly harder game, in terms of computational complexity, than chess (2,
14): it is played on a larger board, and any captured opponent piece changes sides and may sub-
sequently be dropped anywhere on the board.\\

"deep neural network (p, v) = fθ(s) with parameters θ." - I have no idea what this means, so I need to learn some maths/theory based on machine learning.\\

"AlphaZero uses a general- purpose Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm""
\\

"We trained a separate instance of AlphaZero for each game. Training proceeded
for 700,000 steps (mini-batches of size 4,096) starting from randomly initialised parameters,
using 5,000 first-generation TPUs (15) to generate self-play games and 64 second-generation
TPUs to train the neural networks.1 Further details of the training procedure are provided in the
Methods." - so yeah this is a lot of computational juice, take this with a grain of salt, and look at alternative methods, like deep  learning, it has been years since this paper.\\ 

" in shogi, AlphaZero outperformed Elmo after less than 2 hours
(110k steps);" okay so the number of steps doesn't seem horrendous, \\ 


"AlphaZero searches just
80 thousand positions per second in chess and 40 thousand in shogi, compared to 70 million
for Stockfish and 35 million for Elmo. " - almost a order of magniture more efficient. This is a couple of magnitudes better. \\ 

 static-exchange evaluation (SEE), - need to search this up.\\ 

 "None of the techniques described in this section are used by AlphaZero. It is likely that
some of these techniques could further improve the performance of AlphaZero" - maybe look into this to improve performance, but this almost feels like cheating and against the spirit of A.I.\\ 

"GnuChess" - no way there's a gnu chess!\\


"All of these programs combined their learned evaluation functions with an alpha-beta search
enhanced by a variety of extensions"\\

tldr, this paper focuses on it's algorithm and self play, it clearly works and has strong performance. Though it's boring to implement somthing from 7 years ago, 8 by the time this paper is done. I need to find another method that has been proven to work, I mean I can include this in some way in my program to 
improve performace. \\ 

  
  \subsection{Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a
Learned Model:}

  MuZero seems to be the sucessor of Alpha Zero algorithm, it builds on it, and will achieve superhuman performance even 
  without inputting the rules. \\ 

  Planning algorithms rely on prior knowledge of the environment, limiting their real world use. \\ 

  "t every one of these steps the model predicts the
policy (e.g. the move to play), value function (e.g. the predicted winner), and immediate reward (e.g. the points
scored by playing a move). The model is trained end-to-end, with the sole objective of accurately estimating these
three important quantities, so as to match the improved estimates of policy and value generated by search as well
as the observed reward." - this is really smart but I'd imagine computationally very expensive, maybe it is indeed wiser to 
use mini shogi, and build upon that.\\ 

MDP model?\\

temporal difference learning.\\ 

\section{Gantt Chart}

Finished gantt chart, will start generating data next and work on the project manahgement side of things a while first, before working more on the report.\\ 

1. set up python environment\\
2. generate data using the python library,\\ 
3. make a plan for the symbolic regression model.\\
4. Email Adam about this.\\ 












\section{Time spent tracker: }

Initial idea - coming up with initial idea + project brief + emailing - 7 hours 10 mins\\ 

Further research into existing techniques, approaches and deciding on a suitable approach - 3 hours\\ 

Gantt Chart 5 hours. \\ 


Total spent so far - 15 hours \\ 

2 weeks before Uni starts, 1 week golang, next week C++, so aim for 38 hours work into this.\\ 
1 week want to keep researching techniques etc, what to choose, what technique to use. Email supervisor with 
thoughts and findings, how I'm going to approach this, why I'm doing it this way, where can I improve? 
I want this emailed out in freshers week, ideally one day before freshers week, to show organisation, also along with this, 
want to send over a "mock," project brief and ask for his opinion on it.\\ 
2nd week, I want to finish off last version of project brief and ask if he is happy with it, and then submit in an 
initial version of gantt chart, latex, make it look pretty and ask where I can improve, any glaring flaws etc.\\ 
3rd week, (1st week of uni), go onto the design phase, design my "algorithm," design my environment, efficient, 
python or more impressive if I use C++, then update Adam, be like hey look I've setup my environment, I've done MCTS as a baseline, 
to compare the other approaches with etc, and I've also designed my algorithm/ am going to tech these few techniques see how it 
goes etc.\\ 
week 4, tech various techniques, to appease the markscheme, look into as much tools as possible,
