	Part 3: Supervisor choices: 

	Adam, not much has been written about him, this seems weird 
	for someone I think is proper, perhaps he get's the sort of 
	academics that look down upon such information, which in it
	self speaks volumes. 
	
	- Dangrous 

	I could ask Zag about this guy. 

	Adrina Wilde, again she seems quite interesting when I saw 
	here, don't think she is the way to go, would prefer someone
	else honestly. There was something off about her presentation 
	and manner ofbehaviour. 

	Has weekly meetings so that is good, but am a bit skeptical 
	of the group meeting bs, seems like a waste of time. But 
	should be easy enough to please. 

	Ahmed Atali, allright this guy is a straight up no. 

	*** - Basel Halak, weekly meeting, so that is good, seems like a 
	good choice, cyptography is not really an ara of massive 
	interest to me thought, it can be interesting. 

	** - BooJang Kong, seems to be very helpful with the 
	extra fluff that comes with a project, but leaves you to do 
	the technical stuff on your own, this is a good thing and a
	bad thing. Personally I like it. 


	*** - Corina Cirstea, math is what I need, this is exactly 
	what a part of me is looking for. She seems nice enough as 
	well. 

	** - Dennis Nicole seems to be a good one, un-PC attitude 
	this is pretty good, based af. 

	Enrico Gerding, seems to be one to avoid. 

	Enrico marchioni , seems to be one to avoid , this guy seems
	fucked. 


	*** - Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas, seems to be interesting 

	*** - Graeme Bragg , seems interesting, only seek advice 
	during meetings, seems kind of scuffed. 

	** - Hansung Kim, seems good, worth keeping in mind. 

	Heather Packer , honestly not very thrilled about her, though 
	her research does seem interesting. Basically a worse version 
	of son imo. 


	** - Hikmat Farhat, I know this guy is pretty good, Wouldn't 
	mind getting him for sure. 

	Jennifer Williams, seems to be about audio processing, though 
	she seems fat, and a lack of physical health is a sign of 
	a lack of discipline. 

	Jian Shi, fuck this guy, fuck him. That's all that needs to be 
	said about this piece of shit. 

	Jo Grundy, seems pointless. 

	** - Johnathon Hare, well what can I say he is Johnathon Hare 

	Fuck Julian Rathke, though it's a shame type systems are 
	interesting, so is programming language design, certainly 
	a worthy field of study. 

	** - Leonardo Aniello, he's got that bloackchain rizz, 
	might be worth looking into honeslty 

	Leslie Carr, not interested. 

	Luis Daniel Ibanez - not interested. 

	*** - Mark Weal - seems intersting, look into his researc 		
	*** - Markus Brede - seems interesting, digital finance. 

	Micheal Ng, no thanks 

	Sarah Morris, no thanks, 

 	** - Sebastian Stein, well renowned 

	Allright time to now, have a look at the supervisors area of 
	research and then rank them based on that.
