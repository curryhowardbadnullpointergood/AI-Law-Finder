 Abstract needs like abother 20 minutes of rephrasing, and relooking, and just overall a second look.



need to have a look at the titles of the sections again, and make it appropriate. Should take ike 15 minutes. 


Need to optimise the colours of the Gantt Chart as well as the wording, takes around 20 minutes

Need to reqrite the introduction/project brief section of the Intermin report, for the sake of speeed this has been kept the same as the previous low effort submission. Est time: 30 minutes 


Gantt chart section,  tasks and chart need to be displayed horizontally, for the sake of time/agile skipping for now. Est time: 15 minutes

Adam doesn't mind reading through the whole thing. Adam reads 5 pages, omg this is perfectttt. 
Adam won't read through the whole thing, and if he does he is harsh with himself, so the second time he marks it, he will be harsh. He does say he is harsh on himself, and won't bother over Christmas.

Deep learning network is a pain to get to work.
